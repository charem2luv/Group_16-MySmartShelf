MySmartShelf: Personal Book Tracker Using Sets and Dictionaries

##Project description

MySmartShelf is a basic book tracking program that helps user manage books they've read or want to read.
The user can add a book, mark it as read, and view their collection using sets and dictionaries.
It uses conditional logic to prevent duplicate entries and lets users see how many unread books are left.
The system prevents duplicate entries by checking if a book already exists before adding it.
It also tracks the number of unread books, giving users a quick overview of their reading progress.
if you are looking to read more book MySmartShelf will inform you if there is ony small amount of to read book left.
On the other hand if you are looking for motivation to finish whats left you will be informed so you can keep it up.
It works both ways in both scenarios.
MySmartShelf is a beginner friendly project that demonstrates basic concepts in Python such as:
conditional statements, user input handling, and data structures.
