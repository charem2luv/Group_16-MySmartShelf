MySmartShelf: Personal Book Tracker Using Sets and Dictionaries
It is a basic book tracking program that helps user manage books they've read or want to read.
The user can add a book, mark it as read, and view their collection using sets and dictionaries.
It uses conditional logic to prevent duplicate entries and lets users see how many unread books are left.
