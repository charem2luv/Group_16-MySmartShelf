MySmartShelf: Personal Book Tracker Using Sets and Dictionaries

## Project description

MySmartShelf is a basic book tracking program that helps user manage books they've read or want to read.
The user can add a book, mark it as read, and view their collection using sets and dictionaries.
It uses conditional logic to prevent duplicate entries and lets users see how many unread books are left.
The system prevents duplicate entries by checking if a book already exists before adding it.
It also tracks the number of unread books, giving users a quick overview of their reading progress.
if you are looking to read more book MySmartShelf will inform you if there is ony small amount of to read book left.
On the other hand if you are looking for motivation to finish whats left you will be informed so you can keep it up.
It works both ways in both scenarios.
MySmartShelf is a beginner friendly project that demonstrates basic concepts in Python such as:
conditional statements, user input handling, and data structures.

## Features

**Add Items**: Users can add new items to the shelf with name, quantitiy, and category.

**Edit or Remove Items**: Update item details or delete items from the list.

**Low Stock Alerts**: Automatically notifies users when any item quantity drops below a set threshold.

**Search Functionality**: Quickly find items by name or category.

**Usage Summary**: View a basic report showing items usage trends and stock levels.

## Future improvements 

Barcode Scanner: Allow users to quickly add books by scanning barcodes.

Autocomplete from Databases: Integrate with Google Books, Open Library, or Goodreads to auto-fill book details (title, author, cover, genre).

Chapter Summaries: Auto-generate summaries for each chapter (AI-powered).

Advanced Filters: Sort by genre, author, rating, or custom tags.

Genre/Author Insights: Show which genres/authors you read most.

Goal Tracking: Set yearly/monthly reading goals with progress updates.

Reading Time Estimator: Predict how long it’ll take to finish a book.



## Set-Up Instructions 

Step 1: Install Python
Download and install Python 3 from https://www.python.org/downloads/.
Make sure Python is added to your system's PATH.

Step 2: Download the Project Code
You can get the code in two ways:

Option A: Clone the repository using Git
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/MySmartShelf.git

Option B: Download the ZIP file

1. Go to the GitHub repository page.
2. Click the Code button.
3. Choose Download ZIP.
4. Extract the ZIP file to a folder.

Step 3: Open the Project Folder
Use your terminal or command prompt to go into the folder where the code is saved:
cd MySmartShelf

Step 4: Run the Program
In the terminal or command prompt, run the Python file using:
python mysmartshelf.py
You will see sample actions like adding, editing, removing, and searching for books printed in the terminal.

## Technologies Used

### 1. Python  
Python is a high-level, beginner-friendly programming language used for building the entire logic of this project.  
It handles input, output, and decision-making using built-in control structures.

**In MySmartShelf, Python is used to:**
- Build the book tracking features
- Handle user inputs and print outputs
- Control logic with conditionals and functions

### 2. Sets  
Sets are unordered collections of unique elements in Python.  
They ensure that book titles are stored without duplication.

**Used for:**
- Storing unique book titles
- Preventing duplicates
- Efficient book lookup

### 3. Dictionaries  
Dictionaries store data in key-value pairs.  
They make it easy to map book titles to their reading status.

**Used for:**
- Tracking book status (e.g., "Read", "Unread")
- Updating book information quickly
- Organizing data into categories
  
### 4. Git & GitHub  
Git is a version control system, and GitHub is a platform for sharing and collaborating on code.

**Used for:**
- Tracking project changes over time
- Contributing through forks and pull requests
- Collaborating with others efficiently
